% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics

\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Even with advances in smart grid technology and a growing demand for cost-effective  energy consumption, detailed information about energy usage is often not available for residential electricity consumers. One reason is that household energy usage is monitored at no more than a single point by the utility, only providing information on the aggregate power consumption.  In this paper, we attempt to disaggregate  energy usage data into specific appliances from single-point sensing measurements.  Our method involves extracting turn-on and turn-off signature windows from time-series real and reactive power data to obtain transient characteristics of each appliance.  We focus on determining the appropriate window size for each appliance in order to capture unique signatures.  We present the results of our approach on a publicly available dataset.

\section{Introduction-ML}
%In this section, we provide the motivation and a brief description of the project.  A short discussion of related work in this area, including the methodology of previous competition winners is also provided.  This is followed by an overview of our approach, description of the raw data, and evaluation method.

The objective of residential non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is to monitor the major loads in a home from a single-point.  The alternative is to monitor each appliance individually, however, this scheme typically adds significant cost. Therefore, the challenge with NILM is to accurately disaggregate household energy consumption into the individual appliance level with data from single-point measurements.  

Prior research in the area of NILM has focused on the use of aggregate power consumption patterns as features to identify what appliance is being used and how much energy it is consuming. For example, the authors in \cite{mit} discuss various approaches in NILM, including detecting changes in steady-state power measurements and characterizing them as different events. Some challenges reported by the authors include different loads not exhibiting unique signatures in the 2D feature space and the difficulty in determining steady-state features due to turn-on transient noise.  Some recommended advanced techniques are to include the 3rd order harmonics as a feature and using turn-on transients for event detection.  The methodology in [2] and [3] follows a similar strategy, however, the training and test data are manually generated, resulting in a clean dataset that may not be representative of real household energy usage patterns.  Furthermore, the classification can become challenging if the number of appliances in the home is large. Additionally, the signature of some appliances may drift or vary over time due to operating conditions and the mode in which they are used. 

In this paper, we present a method that focuses on extracting turn-on and turn-off signature windows to obtain transient characteristics of each appliance.  The transient characteristics are observed from the difference of two moving average windows from time-series real and reactive power data.  We focus on determining the appropriate window length for each appliance in order to capture unique signatures.  We present the results of our approach using a publicly available dataset from the Belkin Energy Disaggregation Competition on kaggle.com \cite{Kaggle}. The dataset and methodology are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:dataMethod}.  Section \ref{sec:training} describes the approach for extracting signature windows for each appliance from the training data. Section \ref{sec:cv} describes the cross-validation procedure using the training data.  Section \ref{sec:test} describes application of our approach to the test data.  Finally, Section \ref{sec:concl} discusses results and ideas for future work.
%
%The goal of this paper is to document our approach and share insights and conclusions regarding household energy consumption disaggregation that we observed throughout the project. 

\section{Data and Methodology}\label{sec:dataMethod}
The objective is this.... because of this and the dataset, our methodology is specifically chosen for ...This section provides an overview of the dataset and a description of our methodology. 



Because the dataset is representative of real world appliance usage data, and that we are trying to fine detect multiple appliances and not just major ones, we have chosen a specific methodology.  If we are just detecting major appliances a different methodology can be used.  Strategy is to detect when and appliance turns on and turns off as opposed to steady state characteristics.  Out of 40 appliances per home, only a few exhibit steady state features that allow discrimination from background noise or other appliances.

The dataset is publicly available on the competition website and contains voltage and current harmonics data for four households.  The dataset also contains high frequency noise (EMI) data for each household, but is not required with our approach.  

In this paper, we utilize the complete dataset available from kaggle.com, provided by Belkin Energy \cite{Kaggle}. The set contains data from 4 homes (labeled H1-H4) consisting of both training and testing datasets. The training datasets are used to learn how each appliance in each home looks in terms of the EMI and harmonic signatures and build a model which can be applied to the test datasets for making predictions.  

Two sets of data are supplied by Belkin Energy: Training and Test. Describe each one and show example figures of each. The training data consists of manually generated power consumption for each appliance at each home.  These typically consist of only one appliance switched on at a time, although background noise is present from untagged appliances.  Tagging labels are provided by Belkin, however, these are not precise enough to correctly identify device on and off times.  A discussion for tagging label correction is presented in Section \ref{sec:training}.

For each home, the datasets include the first 5 harmonics of voltage and current measurements the FFT of the high frequency noise (captured every 1.0667 seconds).  The sampling rate is $f_s$ = 2 Mhz, which results in an FFT resolution of $f_r$ = 244.14 Hz. The dataset for each home is composed of several files.  For example, the data for H4 contains two training datasets and four testing datasets. The size and description of the files associated with each training and testing dataset are detailed in the tables below.

\section{Training - Signature Window Extraction}\label{sec:training}
This section concentrates on extracting transient signature windows by using the real and the reactive power differences.  In particular, two ON/OFF signature windows are trained for each event of the appliances at each home.  The following sections describe training signature windows depending on the shape of the load.  


\subsection{Load Types}
First, the appliances are categorized into three load types based on their load shape in P and Q.  The types include rectangular, non-rectangular, and cyclic loads:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Rectangular loads:} These type of loads consume constant power when operating and their transient period is characterized by a sharp transition from zero to rated power consumption.  Their load shapes are generally rectangular and consist of primarily resistive loads, such as lights, heaters, and kettles.  Some inductive loads, such as small fans, also exhibit this load shape.  A short duration window consisting of the real and the reactive power differences are used to detect these loads.
\newline
\item{Non-rectangular loads:} These type of loads have a longer transient period when turning on and include computers and TVs.  Their transient period is characterized by a stepwise transition from zero to rated power consumption.  Although the power consumed may vary based on how the device is operated, the turn-on signatures can be unique, allowing discrimination against other devices.  These type of loads require a longer window length to capture the unique transient shape.
\newline
\item{Cyclical loads:} - The amount of real or reactive power consumed by these loads change depending on the cycle of their operation.  Dryer, oven, and washers are included in this category.   However, because they operate on set cycles, there are only a few possible periodic load shapes they can follow.  Two approaches are suggested to detect these type of loads; using multiple windows or detecting a notable landmark during the operation.
\end{enumerate}
Based on these three general load shapes, 

\subsection{Average Power Differences}
Average power differences are used to detect step changes in real and reactive power consumption. Now to train the windows, the real and the reactive power differences are calculated from two moving average windows.  The average differences for real power $S_{P}(n)$ is defined as,
\begin{equation}
S_{P}(n) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N}P(n-k) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=N+D}^{2N+D}P(n-k)
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the window size and $D$ is the distance between the two windows.  The average differences for reactive power, $S_{Q}(n)$, is calculated using the same $N$ and $D$.  It should be noted that if shorter window size is used, it is easier to distinguish events from other events happening at the same incidence.  However, the detector becomes less robust to noise.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/maw.eps}
	\caption{Two Moving Average Windows.}
	\label{fig:maw}
\end{figure}

Using the power difference,  the mismatches in the tagging info and the actual event index are corrected.  A threshold for the real power difference is set to indicate whether an event occurred, (event occurred if $|S(n)| >$ threshold).  Then this corrected indexes are used as the actual event index instead of the tagging info provided.  On the top plot of Fig. \ref{fig:tagging}, the tagging info of the master room lights do not align with the actual event incidence.  The red markers in the bottom plot shows when the power difference is greater than the threshold and this index is used as the corrected tagging info.  It should be noted that we discarded some appliances that consumes very small real or reactive power.  For these appliances, using real and reactive power differences will rather cause more false alarms in the test data due to the effects of the noises.

	\caption{Tagging Info Correction.}
	\label{fig:tagging}
\end{figure}
	

\subsection{Signature Window Extraction}
After taking the power differences, the next stop is to extract the signatures for on-events and off-events. The windows are extracted starting from the corrected tagging info.  If an appliance has an longer transient characteristics (non-rectangular load shapes), longer window size is used to detect event.  For example, consider the dining room light and the laptop charger profile shown in Fig. \ref{fig:windowlength}.  Both the appliances consumes about 38 Watts at event incidence.  However, laptop charger then spends additional 38 Watts to fully turn on.  Therefore, longer window lengths are used to detect laptop charger than in detecting the dining room lights.

	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/windowlength.eps}
	\caption{Simple Distribution Feeder.}
	\label{fig:windowlength}
\end{figure}

Insert windows used for cyclical loads.

Outlier detection is also held in this stage.  Consider the four ON/OFF events of a computer as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:outlier}.  It is shown that when event 2 occurred, some background noise are introduced that affected the turn-on signature of the computer.  In this case, the second event is regarded as an outlier and is not used in training the windows.

distance domain is used to detect outliers

First, an event detector is used in the real power domain to estimate the exact switching time of the event.  By  in the training data.  This is to account for the mismatches of the provided tagging info and the exact switching index.  

A typical rectangular load shape of is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rec}.  Many appliances turned out to have rectangular load shape and these appliances can be separated using real and reactive power consumption features.  Figure \ref{fig:PQ} shows feature space of appliances that have rectangular load shape.  The feature vector of each class are clustered together, implying that the real and reactive power features are sufficient for classifying most of the appliances.


This section concentrates on extracting the feature windows in low frequency data.  In particular the real and the reactive power differences are used to extract these windows.  First, a separate event detector is used to correct the   event detector is used in the Training Data to correct the mismatches 



The procedures for calculating the real power and the reactive power include event detection, data smoothing, and power calculation.

\section{Validation-ML}\label{sec:cv}
Discuss cross validation here. this is the whole procedure for generating thresholds.

Although data is high resolution (and therefore high dimensional in number of rows), the majority of information unique to each appliance is concentrated to turn-on and turn-off signatures.  This is due to the fact that when multiple appliances are running, the absolute level cannot be used to detect whether one specific appliance is on or not.  The change in real and reactive power consumption must be used to detect which appliance has turned on.  

Prior to submitting our predictions, the 

need figures as examples of P/Q domain, diff domain, distance domain, window shape (big subplot 3x3?)

show how signatures for small appliances, those of the same type in different locations, can produce different signature windows, allowing for separation.

\section{Test Data}\label{sec:test}
- rules for on/off pairing

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}
The conclusion goes here. All insight gained from competition. Too many appliances, noisy test data, what is the benefit of identifying small appliances?, noise necessitates clear features (large distance).  also high freqency domain for hard to identify appliances.  you can get 20th w/ just P/Q alone.   

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
Using this dataset, a lot of effort was put into cleaning the data.  Specifically, the tagging information for appliance on off events was not precise enough to accurately extract on and off signatures windows automatically.  However, if these event tags were generated correctly, event signature windows could be automatically extracted form the training data. 

\subsection{Load Types}
discuss difficulty of classification based on load types:

-constant power - static: can be difficult if rated power is similar between two appliances, same for below.
- resistive (lights, heaters, kettle) - P domain and rectangular mainly, can be separated in P domain only if turn on/off signature is unique or if rated power is not similar to others
- resistive + reactive (rotating like fans) - Q is a feature to help classify; if P is not unique, but Q is, greatly increases classification
-dynamic
	- cyclical (washer dryer) - require rules, ie. landmark detection
