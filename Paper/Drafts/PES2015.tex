% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}

%\usepackage{algpseudocode}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Even with advances in smart grid technology and a growing demand for cost-effective  energy consumption, detailed information about energy usage is often not available for residential electricity consumers. One reason is that household energy usage is typically monitored at no more than a single point, only providing information on the aggregate power consumption.  In this paper, we attempt to disaggregate  energy usage data into specific appliances from single-point sensing measurements.  Our method involves extracting turn-on and turn-off signature windows from real and reactive power time series data to obtain transient characteristics of each appliance.  We focus on determining the appropriate window size for each appliance in order to capture unique signatures.  We present the results of our approach on a publicly available dataset.

\section{Introduction}
%In this section, we provide the motivation and a brief description of the project.  A short discussion of related work in this area, including the methodology of previous competition winners is also provided.  This is followed by an overview of our approach, description of the raw data, and evaluation method.

The objective of residential non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is to determine the power consumption of major loads in a home from a single-point.  The alternative is to monitor each appliance individually, however, this scheme typically adds significant cost. Therefore, the challenge with residential NILM is to accurately disaggregate household energy consumption into the individual appliance level with data from single-point measurements from the service entrance panel.  

Prior research in the area of NILM has focused on the use of aggregate power consumption patterns as features to identify what appliance is being used and how much energy it is consuming. For example, \cite{mit} discusses various approaches in NILM, including detecting changes in steady-state power measurements and characterizing them as different events. Some challenges reported include different loads not exhibiting unique signatures in the 2-D feature space and the difficulty in determining steady-state features due to turn-on transient noise.  Recommended advanced techniques include 3rd order harmonics as a feature and use turn-on transients for event detection.  The methodology in \cite{adaptive, EMI, prob, Hart, Shaw, Lin, Wave} follows a similar strategy.  Furthermore, the classification can become challenging if the number of appliances in the home is large. Additionally, the signature of some appliances may change or vary over time due to operating conditions and the mode in which they are used. 

In this paper, we present a method that focuses on extracting turn-on and turn-off signature windows to obtain transient characteristics of each appliance.  The transient characteristics are observed from the difference of two moving average windows from real and reactive power time series data.  We focus on determining the appropriate window length for each appliance in order to capture unique signatures.  We present the results of our approach using a publicly available dataset from the Belkin Energy Disaggregation Competition on kaggle.com \cite{Kaggle}. The dataset and methodology are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:dataMethod}.  Section \ref{sec:training} describes how signature windows are extracted for each appliance from the training data. Section \ref{sec:cv} then describes the cross-validation procedure using the training data and also application to the test data. Finally, Section \ref{sec:concl} discusses results and topics for future work.

%Because the set of appliances in each home includes multiple small devices with similar steady-state load characteristics, our methodology focuses on identifying the unique features when a device turns on and off (the transient periods).  Out of approximately 37 appliances per home, only a small subset of appliances have pronounced steady state features that allow discrimination from other appliances or background noise. 

\section{Approach}\label{sec:dataMethod}
%The objective is this.... because of this and the dataset, our methodology is specifically chosen for ...This section provides an overview of the dataset and a description of our methodology. 

In this section, we describe the dataset and our methodology for detecting turn-on and turn-off events of appliances in the test data. 

\subsection{Dataset}
We utilize the complete dataset from the Belkin Energy Disaggregation Competition hosted on kaggle.com, provided by Belkin Energy \cite{Kaggle}.  The dataset is publicly available on the competition website and contains single-point sensing measurements from the service entrance panel for four households (labeled H1-H4).  The measurements include the first five harmonics of rms voltage and current on two phases and high frequency noise (EMI) data for each household.  The EMI data is not required with our approach (see further discussion in Section \ref{sec:concl}).  Although both training and test datasets are provided, only the training data provides labels and corresponding timestamps for each appliance. Table \ref{table:dataset} shows the number of distinct appliances in each home and the number of training and test sets provided. 

Each training set consists of manually generated power consumption data for each appliance in each home.  The training data is a time series where only one appliance is switched on at a time, although background noise can be present from untagged appliances. Tagging labels in the training data are also provided, however, these are not always precise enough to correctly identify device turn-on and turn-off times. Correction of tagging labels for training data is therefore needed and is discussed in Section \ref{sec:training}.  Fig.\ref{fig:traintest} shows an example of both training and test data from H2.  The observations recorded in each training and test set cover approximately 24 hours.

\subsection{Methodology}
Our goal is to develop an interpretable yet effective classification approach.  It can be observed from Fig. \ref{fig:traintest} (b) that the test data is the aggregated load of multiple appliances.  Therefore, at any given time, it is not possible to determine which appliances are operating by using only the level of power consumption.  However, when an appliance is turned on or off, a step change is produced in real and reactive power.  By comparing the average power consumed before and after these transient events, we can calculate an averaged power difference time series, facilitating discrimination among appliances. A flow chart of the proposed methodology is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:flow}.

The first step is to extract transient signature windows for each appliance.  Raw data is converted from a power time series ($\text{P}_{\text{rms}}$ and $\text{Q}_{\text{rms}}$ ) into an averaged power difference time series ($\Delta P_{avg}$ and $\Delta Q_{avg}$) by taking the difference of two moving average windows.  After $\Delta P_{avg}$ and $\Delta Q_{avg}$ are calculated, transient signature windows are extracted for each appliance.  Each signature window, $w_{i,j}$ is of length $\text{N}_{i,j}$, meaning each $i^{\text{th}}$ appliance and corresponding $j^{\text{th}}$ turn-on or turn-off event in the training data has a signature window with its own specified window length. The procedure is explained in detail in Section \ref{sec:training}. 

Once transient signatures are extracted for each appliance in the training data, cross-validation is performed.  The objective of this step is to determine the ability of each signature window to only detect other events of the same appliance. If an appliance can not be detected during cross-validation, it will not be predicted in the test set. For the test set, we use the cross-validated signature windows and threshold values to calculate an RMSE time series and detect appliance turn-on and turn-off events. The procedure is presented in Section \ref{sec:cv}. The results and conclusion are discussed in Section \ref{sec:concl}.  

\begin{figure}[!t]

	\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{fig/flow.png}
	\caption{Flow chart of proposed methodology.  The procedure is separated into window extraction, cross-validation, and application to test data.}
	\label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}


\section{Signature Window Extraction}\label{sec:training}
This section describes how transient signature windows are extracted by using the averaged real and reactive power difference time series.  In particular, a pair of turn-on and turn-off signature windows are trained for every event of each appliance in the training data.  


\subsection{Load Types}
The appliances are first categorized into three load types based on their load shapes in P and Q.  The types include rectangular, non-rectangular, and cyclic loads:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Rectangular loads:} These types of loads consume constant power during steady-state operation and their transient period is characterized by a sharp transition from zero to rated power consumption.  Their load shapes are generally rectangular and consist primarily of resistive loads, such as incandescent lights and appliances with heating elements.  Some inductive loads, such as small fans, also exhibit this load shape.  A short duration signature window in the real and the reactive power difference time series is used to detect these loads.  An example is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:maw}.
\newline
\item{Non-rectangular loads:} These types of loads have a longer transient period when turning on and include computers and TVs.  Their transient period is characterized by a stepwise or gradual transition from zero to rated power consumption.  Although the power consumed may vary based on how the device is operated, the turn-on and turn-off signatures can be unique, allowing discrimination against other devices.  These types of loads require a longer signature window length to capture their unique transient shape.  An example is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:nonrec}.
\newline
\item{Cyclical loads:} The amount of real or reactive power consumed by these loads change depending on the cycle of their operation.  Dryers, ovens, and washers are included in this category.   However, because they operate on preset cycles, there are only a few possible periodic load shapes they can follow.  A modified approach is required to detect these type of loads: identifying notable recurrent patterns during appliance operation.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height = 2.4in,width=3.5in]{fig/maw2.eps}
	\caption{Difference of two moving average windows to calculate averaged power difference time series.  The bottom plot shows the transient signature for incandescent bedroom lights.}
	\label{fig:maw}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height = 2.4in,width=3.5in]{fig/nonrec.eps}
	\caption{Example of a non-rectangular load shape (TV in Home 2) showing longer turn-on transient than rectangular loads.}
	\label{fig:nonrec}
\end{figure}

%Illustrative examples of these load types are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:exLoads}.  The dryer for example produces several rectangular step changes over the course of its cycle, resulting in misclassifications if not accounted for.  The modified approach for detecting these appliance is discussed below.

\subsection{Averaged Power Difference Time Series}
Our approach relies on identifying appliance turn-on and turn-off events by detecting unique transient signatures in real and reactive power consumption. To extract transient signatures for each appliance, unique characteristics are observed in the averaged power difference time series. This calculation is made from two moving average windows.  The averaged difference for real power, $\Delta P_{avg}(n)$, is defined as,
\begin{equation}
\Delta P_{avg}(n) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}P(n-k) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=N+D}^{2N+D-1}P(n-k)
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the window size and $D$ is the distance between the two windows.  The averaged difference for reactive power, $\Delta Q_{avg}(n)$, is calculated using the same $N$ and $D$.  It should be noted that if a shorter window size is used, it is easier to distinguish events happening at the same incidence.  However, the detector becomes less robust to noise.

Using the averaged power difference time series to determine true appliance event indices, tagging labels from the raw data are first corrected.  A threshold in the averaged real power difference is then set to indicate whether an event occurred, (i.e., an event occurred if $|\Delta P_{avg}(n)| >$ threshold).  Then the corrected indices are used as the actual event index instead of the tagging info provided in the raw data.  On the top plot of Fig. \ref{fig:tagging}, the tagging labels of the bedroom lights do not align with the actual event incidence.  The bottom plot shows when the first index of the averaged power difference is greater than the threshold; this index is used as the corrected tagging label.  It should be noted that some appliances that consume very small real or reactive power are discarded as they can not be detected.  For these appliances, using real and reactive power difference will cause false detections in the test data due to the effects of the noise.  Additional features must be considered to detect such appliances.

\subsection{Window Extraction}
After calculating the averaged power difference time series, the next step is to extract the signatures for turn-on  and turn-off events.  For rectangular load shapes, transient signature windows are extracted from the start of the turn-on event until the load reaches steady-state power consumption.  If an appliance has longer transient characteristics (non-rectangular load shape), a longer window size is used to capture the entire unique transient period.  For example, consider the dining room light and the laptop charger profile shown in Fig. \ref{fig:windowlength}.  Both the appliances consume about 38 W at event incidence.  However, the laptop charger requires additional power to fully turn on.  Therefore, if a longer window length is used, this characteristic is captured in the averaged power difference time series and can be used to discriminate it from other similar appliances. Thus, extracted signature windows $w_{i,j}$, define the unique transient characteristics in the averaged power difference time series for each event of each appliance in the training data.  Table \ref{table:winLen} provides the range for the lengths of extracted signature windows, categorized by load type.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height = 2.4in, width=3.5in]{fig/windowlength.eps}
	\caption{Example of how choosing the appropriate window length can affect classification.}
	\label{fig:windowlength}
\end{figure}

Cyclical loads exhibit unique characteristics that are different from the rectangular and the non-rectangular loads.  These types of appliances are difficult to be detected by using turn-on and turn-off signature windows because each step change in power consumption during the cycle can appear as individual appliances turning on and off. Therefore, for cyclical loads only, a window is trained to capture recurrent patterns during their operation.  Consider the dryer in Home 2 as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dryerH2}.  The load shape of the dryer has multiple sharp peaks during its operation.  Therefore, a single window can be trained to detect these sharp peaks.  In this case, the following rule can be made:  ``While the recurrent pattern window is detecting an event, the appliance is operating."  

Outlier detection is also held during this stage.  Consider the four on/off events of a computer as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:outlier}.  It can be seen that when event two occurred, some background noise affected the turn-on signature of the computer.  In this case, the second event is regarded as an outlier and is not used in training the windows.

\section{Cross-Validation and Testing}\label{sec:cv}
In this section, we present the procedure for cross-validating the classification performance of the signature windows trained in Section \ref{sec:training}.  The objective of cross-validation is to verify the ability of each signature window to detect other events of the same appliance in the training data.  The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is chosen as the metric to determine how well the signature window matches with the measured signal.  The equations for calculating RMSE are shown in (\ref{eq:RMSE-P}) and (\ref{eq:RMSE-Q}),
\begin{align}
\label{eq:RMSE-P}
\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}(n) &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}(w_{i,j}(k) - \Delta P_{avg}(n+k))^2}\\
\label{eq:RMSE-Q}
\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}(n) &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}(w_{i,j}(k) - \Delta Q_{avg}(n+k))^2}
\end{align}
where $w_{i,j}$ is the transient signature window, with length $N = N_{i,j}$, for the $j^{\text{th}}$ turn-on or turn-off event for appliance number $i$.  Additionally, log(RMSE) is taken to make the minimum more distinct.  

%\begin{algorithm}
%	\caption{Cross-validation Algorithm}\label{euclid}
%	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
%		\For{every time instant $n_0$}	
%
%		\State Calculate $\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}(n_0)$ and $\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}(n_0)$
%		\If{$\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}(n_0)<\theta_P$ and $\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}(n_0)<\theta_Q$ } 
%		determine if threshhold (theta) exists for which log(RMSE)<1.3*theta is able to detect 100 \% of appliances i in the training set and none of the other  N-1 appliances in the training set
%		
%		\State Event is detected at time instant $n_0$
%		\EndIf
%		%		\EndFor
%		\EndFor
%	\end{algorithmic}
%\end{algorithm}
%
%This step involves moving  $\Delta P_{avg}(n)$ or $\Delta Q_{avg}(n)$ past the extracted signature window to calculate the root-mean-squared error (RMSE).  
%apply signature window w(n)i,j
% (that's why 1.3*theta)
%need to determine P and Q thresholds simultaneously


%This step involves sliding $\Delta P_{avg}(n)$ or $\Delta Q_{avg}(n)$ past each extracted signature window to calculate the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) at each time step.  Turn-on and turn-off events are detected in the resulting time series when RMSE falls below a specified threshold simultaneously in both the real and reactive power difference.   

An example for the cross-validation procedure is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:bread} for the breadmaker.  $\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}$ and $\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}$ is calculated between the averaged power difference time series and the signature window for the appliance. Both $\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}$ and $\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}$ simultaneously reach a minimum when the extracted signature window closely matches the measured signal.  This corresponds to the time when the associated appliance turns on or off in the averaged power difference time series. However, other appliances switching on and off cause $\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}$ and $\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}$ value to vary and it is possible that both the RMSE values drop due to switching of an appliance with a similar transient characteristics.  This happens when the signature windows of the two appliances have a very similar shape and amplitude.  To prevent this misclassification, RMSE thresholds ($\theta_P$ and $\theta_Q$) are set to prevent other appliances from being detected.  If such thresholds ($\theta_P$ and $\theta_Q$) can not be set, the window is discarded.  In this example, the window successfully detects the breadmaker turning-on with all the other events being rejected in the training set.  The cross-validation results for all appliances are shown in Table \ref{table:cv}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/cv_bread.eps}

We then apply our algorithm to the provided test data and identify appliance operating intervals.  The detections are made from the signature windows extracted from the training set with the threshold values acquired from cross-validation.  The algorithm is shown below and is applied for every extracted signature window $w_{i,j}$.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Event Detection Algorithm}\label{euclid}

			\If{$\text{RMSE}_{\text{P}}(n_0)<\theta_P$ and $\text{RMSE}_{\text{Q}}(n_0)<\theta_Q$ } 
			\State Event is detected at time instant $n_0$
			\EndIf
%		\EndFor
	\EndFor
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}
From our cross-validation and test results, the proposed strategy can be a simple yet effective method for disaggregation of household energy usage. One of the advantages of this approach is that it is more interpretable because it follows an intuitive approach for detecting appliance on and off events.  With the proposed approach, misclassifications can be traced back to the signature window length or detection thresholds.  This is particularly true when compared to methods utilizing ``black box" predictive models such as artificial neural networks.  Furthermore, the proposed approach has the ability for real time processing. Because calculations are implemented as sliding windows, data can be streamed into the algorithm. Additionally, this method only utilized a subset of the entire dataset, needing only P and Q measurements.  High frequency features could have been added to help classify smaller appliances that were discarded during cross-validation.  One of the primary drawbacks, however, is that manual identification of appropriate window lengths is required during training.  Future work would consider automation of appropriate window lengths.
