% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Even with advances in smart grid technology and a growing demand for cost-effective  energy consumption, detailed information about energy usage is often not available for residential electricity consumers. One reason is that household energy usage is monitored at no more than a single point by the utility, only providing information on the aggregate power consumption.  In this paper, we attempt to disaggregate  energy usage data into specific appliances from single-point sensing measurements.  Our method involves extracting turn-on and turn-off signature windows from time-series real and reactive power data to obtain transient characteristics of each appliance.  We focus on determining the appropriate window size for each appliance in order to capture unique signatures.  We present the results of our approach on a publicly available dataset.

\section{Introduction}
%In this section, we provide the motivation and a brief description of the project.  A short discussion of related work in this area, including the methodology of previous competition winners is also provided.  This is followed by an overview of our approach, description of the raw data, and evaluation method.

The objective of residential non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is to monitor the major loads in a home from a single-point.  The alternative is to monitor each appliance individually, however, this scheme typically adds significant cost. Therefore, the challenge with NILM is to accurately disaggregate household energy consumption into the individual appliance level with data from single-point measurements.  

Prior research in the area of NILM has focused on the use of aggregate power consumption patterns as features to identify what appliance is being used and how much energy it is consuming. For example, the authors in \cite{mit} discuss various approaches in NILM, including detecting changes in steady-state power measurements and characterizing them as different events. Some challenges reported by the authors include different loads not exhibiting unique signatures in the 2D feature space and the difficulty in determining steady-state features due to turn-on transient noise.  Some recommended advanced techniques are to include the 3rd order harmonics as a feature and using turn-on transients for event detection.  The methodology in [2] and [3] follows a similar strategy, however, the training and test data are manually generated, resulting in a clean dataset that may not be representative of real household energy usage patterns.  Furthermore, the classification can become challenging if the number of appliances in the home is large. Additionally, the signature of some appliances may drift or vary over time due to operating conditions and the mode in which they are used. 

In this paper, we present a method that focuses on extracting turn-on and turn-off signature windows to obtain transient characteristics of each appliance.  The transient characteristics are observed from the difference of two moving average windows from time-series real and reactive power data.  We focus on determining the appropriate window length for each appliance in order to capture unique signatures.  We present the results of our approach using a publicly available dataset from the Belkin Energy Disaggregation Competition on kaggle.com \cite{Kaggle}. The dataset and methodology are described in detail in Section \ref{sec:dataMethod}.  Section \ref{sec:training} describes the approach for extracting signature windows for each appliance from the training data. Section \ref{sec:cv} describes the cross-validation procedure using the training data.  Section \ref{sec:test} describes application of our approach to the test data.  Finally, Section \ref{sec:concl} discusses results and ideas for future work.
%
%The goal of this paper is to document our approach and share insights and conclusions regarding household energy consumption disaggregation that we observed throughout the project. 

\section{Data and Methodology}\label{sec:dataMethod}
%The objective is this.... because of this and the dataset, our methodology is specifically chosen for ...This section provides an overview of the dataset and a description of our methodology. 

In this section, we describe the dataset that was used and our methodology for detecting appliances in the test data. Because the set of appliances in each home includes multiple small devices with similar steady-state load characteristics, our methodology focuses on identifying the unique features when a device turns on and off (the transient periods).  Out of approximately 37 appliances per home, only a small subset exhibits steady state features that allow discrimination from other appliances or background noise.

In this paper, we utilize the complete dataset available from kaggle.com, provided by Belkin Energy \cite{Kaggle}.  The dataset is publicly available on the competition website and contains the first five harmonics of rms voltage and current on two phases for four households (labeled H1-H4). The dataset also contains high frequency noise (EMI) data for each household, but is not required with our approach (see further discussion in Section \ref{sec:concl}).  Although both training and test datasets are provided, only the training data provides labels and corresponding timestamps for each appliance. Table \ref{table:dataset} shows the number of distinct appliances in each home an the number of training and test sets provided.

\end{table}

The training sets consist of manually generated power consumption data for each appliance in each home.  The training data is a time-serires where only one appliance is switched on at a time, although background noise can be present from untagged appliances.   Tagging labels in the training data are also provided by Belkin, however, these are not always precise enough to correctly identify device on and off times. Tagging label correction is discussed in Section \ref{sec:training}.  Fig.\ref{fig:traintest} shows an example of both training and test data from H2.  The observations recorded in each training and test set cover approximately 24 hours.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Methodology}
Our goal is to develop an interpretable yet effective classification approach.  It can be observed from Fig. \ref{fig:traintest} (b) that the test data is the aggregated load of multiple appliances.  Therefore, at any given time, it is not possible to determine which appliances are operating by using only the level of power consumption.  However, when an appliance is turned on or off, a step change is produced in real and reactive power.  By comparing the average power consumed before and after these transient events, we can calculate averaged power differences, facilitating discrimination among appliances.  For this reason, our methodology focuses on detecting unique turn-on and turn-off signatures in the power differences domain for each appliance.

The first step is to extract transient signature windows for each appliance and is accomplished by  converting P and Q domain into the differences domain by taking the difference of two moving average windows .  After P and Q differences are calculated, transient signature windows are extracted for each appliance.  This procedure is explained in detail in section \ref{sec:training}. 

Once transient signature windows are extracted for each appliance event in the training data, cross-validation is performed to determine if the signature windows are unique.  This procedure is explained in detail in Section \ref{sec:cv}.

\section{Training - Signature Window Extraction}\label{sec:training}
This section describes how transient signature windows are extracted by using the real and the reactive power differences.  In particular, a pair of turn-on and turn-off signature windows are trained for each event of each appliance.  The following sections describe how training the signature windows is dependent upon the shape of the load.  


\subsection{Load Types}
First, the appliances are categorized into three load types based on their load shape in P and Q.  The types include rectangular, non-rectangular, and cyclic loads:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Rectangular loads:} These type of loads consume constant power when operating and their transient period is characterized by a sharp transition from zero to rated power consumption.  Their load shapes are generally rectangular and consist of primarily resistive loads, such as lights, heaters, and kettles.  Some inductive loads, such as small fans, also exhibit this load shape.  A short duration window consisting of the real and the reactive power differences are used to detect these loads.
\newline
\item{Non-rectangular loads:} These type of loads have a longer transient period when turning on and include computers and TVs.  Their transient period is characterized by a stepwise transition from zero to rated power consumption.  Although the power consumed may vary based on how the device is operated, the turn-on signatures can be unique, allowing discrimination against other devices.  These type of loads require a longer window length to capture the unique transient shape.
\newline
\item{Cyclical loads:} - The amount of real or reactive power consumed by these loads change depending on the cycle of their operation.  Dryer, oven, and washers are included in this category.   However, because they operate on set cycles, there are only a few possible periodic load shapes they can follow.  Two approaches are suggested to detect these type of loads; using multiple windows or detecting a notable landmark during the operation.
\end{enumerate}
%Based on these three general load shapes, 

\subsection{Averaged Power Differences}
Moving average differences are used to detect step changes in real and reactive power consumption. To train the windows, the real and the reactive power differences are calculated from two moving average windows.  The average differences for real power $S_{P}(n)$ is defined as,
\begin{equation}
S_{P}(n) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}P(n-k) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=N+D}^{2N+D-1}P(n-k)
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the window size and $D$ is the distance between the two windows.  The average differences for reactive power, $S_{Q}(n)$, is calculated using the same $N$ and $D$.  It should be noted that if a shorter window size is used, it is easier to distinguish events happening at the same incidence.  However, the detector becomes less robust to noise.

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/maw.eps}
	\caption{Difference of two moving average windows to detect transient signatures.}
	\label{fig:maw}
\end{figure}

Using the power difference,  the mismatches in the tagging info and the actual event index are corrected.  A threshold for the real power difference is set to indicate whether an event occurred, (event occurred if $|S(n)| >$ threshold).  Then the corrected indexes are used as the actual event index instead of the tagging info provided in the raw data.  On the top plot of Fig. \ref{fig:tagging}, the tagging labels of the master bedroom lights do not align with the actual event incidence.  The red markers in the bottom plot shows when the power difference is greater than the threshold; this index is used as the corrected tagging label.  It should be noted that some appliances that consumes very small real or reactive power are discarded as they cannot be detected.  For these appliances, using real and reactive power differences will cause false detections in the test data due to the effects of the noise.

\end{figure}
	

\subsection{Signature Window Extraction}
After taking the power differences, the next stop is to extract the signatures for turn-on events and turn-off events. The windows are extracted using the corrected tagging labels.  If an appliance has longer transient characteristics (non-rectangular load shapes), longer window sizes are used to capture the entire unique transient period.  For example, consider the dining room light and the laptop charger profile shown in Fig. \ref{fig:windowlength}.  Both the appliances consume about 38 W at event incidence.  However, the laptop charger then spends additional 38 Watts to fully turn on.  Therefore, longer window lengths are needed to detect laptop charger than the dining room lights.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/windowlength.eps}
	\caption{Example of how choosing the appropriate window length can affect classification.}
	\label{fig:windowlength}
\end{figure}

Cyclical loads exhibit unique characteristics that are different from the rectangular and non-rectangular loads.  For these type of loads, separate rules are made for the detection.  Consider the oven shown in Fig. \ref{fig:demon}.  In addition to the turn-on signature window, the real power waveform consistently rises and falls until the appliance is turned off.  This additional changes are trained as separate signature windows to indicate that the oven is still in operation.  

Similarly, dryers in Home 2 consistently shows sharp peaks while operating as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dryerH2}.  Signature windows are trained to detect these sharp peaks to indicate that dryer is in operation in Home 2.  It should be noted that, some delays are introduced because this sharp peaks doesn't always occur at the exact time of the switching time.

Outlier detection is also held in this stage.  Consider the four ON/OFF events of a computer as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:outlier}.  It is shown that when event 2 occurred, some background noise are introduced that affected the turn-on signature of the computer.  In this case, the second event is regarded as an outlier and is not used in training the windows.

\section{Validation}\label{sec:cv}
Although data is high resolution (and therefore high dimensional in number of rows), the majority of information unique to each appliance is concentrated to turn-on and turn-off signatures.  

Prior to submitting our predictions, the 

need figures as examples of P/Q domain, diff domain, distance domain, window shape (big subplot 3x3?)

\section{Test Data}\label{sec:test}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}
The conclusion goes here. All insight gained from competition. Too many appliances, noisy test data, what is the benefit of identifying small appliances?, noise necessitates clear features (large distance).  also high freqency domain for hard to identify appliances.  you can get 20th w/ just P/Q alone.   

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
Using this dataset, a lot of effort was put into cleaning the data.  Specifically, the tagging information for appliance on off events was not precise enough to accurately extract on and off signatures windows automatically.  However, if these event tags were generated correctly, event signature windows could be automatically extracted form the training data. 

\subsection{Load Types}
discuss difficulty of classification based on load types:

-constant power - static: can be difficult if rated power is similar between two appliances, same for below.
- resistive (lights, heaters, kettle) - P domain and rectangular mainly, can be separated in P domain only if turn on/off signature is unique or if rated power is not similar to others
- resistive + reactive (rotating like fans) - Q is a feature to help classify; if P is not unique, but Q is, greatly increases classification
-dynamic
	- cyclical (washer dryer) - require rules, ie. landmark detection
	
\subsection{Tradeoffs}
One of the advantages of this approach is that it is more interpretable as it follows intuition for detecting appliance on and off events.  With the proposed approach, misclassifications can be traced back to the signature window length or detection thresholds.  This is particularly true when compared to methods utilizing 'black box' predictive models such as artificial neural networks.  Furthermore, the proposed approach as the ability for real time processing.

However, one of the primary drawbacks is that manual identification of appropriate window lengths is requried during training.
