% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
% driver is specified.
% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
\usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

	\section{Training - Signature Window Extraction}
	This section concentrates on extracting the signature windows by using the real and the reactive power differences.  In particular, two ON/OFF signature windows are trained for each event of the appliances at each Home.  The following sections describe training signature windows depending on the shape of the load.  
	
	\subsection{Load Types}
	First, the appliances are categorized into three load types based on its shape.  The types include rectangular, non-rectangular, and cyclic loads.  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Rectangular loads:} These type of loads consumes constant power when operating.  The load shapes are rectangular.  They include resistive loads, such as lights, heaters, and kettle, and reactive loads such as fans.  A short duration window consisting of the real and the reactive power differences are used to detect these loads.
		\item{Non-rectangular loads:} These type of loads have a longer transient characteristics when turning on.  They include computers and TVs.  These type of loads require longer window length than the rectangular loads.
		\item{Cyclical loads:} - These type of loads change it's shape depending on the cycle of their operation.  Dryer, oven, and washers are included in this category.  Two approaches are suggested to detect these type of loads; using multiple windows or detecting a notable landmark during the operation.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Smoothed Power Differences}
	Now to train the windows, the real and the reactive power differences are calculated from two moving average windows.  The smoothed difference $S(n)$ is defined as,
	\begin{equation}
		S(n) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=0}^{N}P(n-k) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=N+D}^{2N+D}P(n-k)
	\end{equation}
	where $N$ is the window size and $D$ is the distance between the two windows. 
	It should be noted that if shorter window size is used, it is easier to distinguish events from other events happening at the same incidence.  However, the detector becomes less robust to noise.
	
	\begin{figure}[!t]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/maw.eps}
		\caption{Two Moving Average Windows.}
		\label{fig:maw}
	\end{figure}
	
	Using the power difference,  the mismatches in the tagging info and the actual event index are corrected.  A threshold for the real power difference is set to indicate whether an event occurred, (event occurred if $|S(n)| >$ threshold).  Then this corrected indexes are used as the actual event index instead of the tagging info provided.  On the top plot of Fig. \ref{fig:tagging}, the tagging info of the master room lights do not align with the actual event incidence.  The red markers in the bottom plot shows when the power difference is greater than the threshold and this index is used as the corrected tagging info.  It should be noted that we discarded some appliances that consumes very small real or reactive power.  For these appliances, using real and reactive power differences will rather cause more false alarms in the test data due to the effects of the noises. 
	
	\begin{figure}[!t]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/masterlights.eps}
		\caption{Tagging Info Correction.}
		\label{fig:tagging}
	\end{figure}
	
	<<<<<<< HEAD
	\subsection{Signature Window Extraction}
	After taking the power differences, the next stop is to extract the signatures for on-events and off-events. The windows are extracted starting from the corrected tagging info until the real and reactive power waveforms reach steady-state.  The power differences will increase to the rated power consumption of the appliance and decrease to zero, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:maw}.
	
	If an appliance has an longer transient characteristics (non-rectangular load shapes), longer window size is used to detect event.  For example, consider the dining room light and the laptop charger profile shown in Fig. \ref{fig:windowlength}.  Both the appliances consumes about 38 Watts at event incidence.  However, laptop charger then spends additional 38 Watts to fully turn on.  Therefore, longer window lengths are used to detect laptop charger than in detecting the dining room lights. 
	
	\begin{figure}[!t]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/windowlength.eps}
		\caption{Simple Distribution Feeder.}
		\label{fig:windowlength}
	\end{figure}
	
	Cyclical loads exhibit unique characteristics that are different from the rectangular and non-rectangular loads.  For these type of loads, separate rules are made for the detection.  Consider the oven shown in Fig. \ref{fig:demon}.  In addition to the turn-on signature window, the real power waveform consistently rises and falls until the appliance is turned off.  This additional changes are trained as separate signature windows to indicate that the oven is still in operation.  
	
	Similarly, dryers in Home 2 consistently shows sharp peaks while operating as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dryerH2}.  On the other hand, no unique turn-on or turn-off characteristics are found for this appliance.  Signature windows are trained to detect these sharp peaks to indicate that dryer is in operation in Home 2.  It should be noted that, some delays are introduced because this sharp peaks doesn't always occur at the exact time of the switching time.
		
	\begin{figure}[!t]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig/dryerH2.eps}
		\caption{Simple Distribution Feeder.}
		\label{fig:dryerH2}
	\end{figure}
	
	Outlier detection is also held in this stage.  Consider the four ON/OFF events of a computer as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:outlier}.  It is shown that when event 2 occurred, some background noise are introduced that affected the turn-on signature of the computer.  In this case, the second event is regarded as outliers and is not used in training the windows.

	First a event detector is used in the real power domain to estimate the exact switching time of the event.  By  in the training data.  This is to account for the mismatches of the provided tagging info and the exact switching index.  
	
	A typical rectangular load shape of is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rec}.  Many appliances turned out to have rectangular load shape and these appliances can be separated using real and reactive power consumption features.  Figure \ref{fig:PQ} shows feature space of appliances that have rectangular load shape.  The feature vector of each class are clustered together, implying that the real and reactive power features are sufficient for classifying most of the appliances.
	
	
	This section concentrates on extracting the feature windows in low frequency data.  In particular the real and the reactive power differences are used to extract these windows.  First, a separate event detector is used to correct the   event detector is used in the Training Data to correct the mismatches 
	
	
	
	The procedures for calculating the real power and the reactive power include event detection, data smoothing, and power calculation.

	need figures as examples of P/Q domain, diff domain, distance domain, window shape (big subplot 3x3?)
	
	\section{Test Data}
	- rules for on/off pairing
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	The conclusion goes here. All insight gained from competition. Too many appliances, noisy test data, what is the benefit of identifying small appliances?, noise necessitates clear features (large distance).  also high freqency domain for hard to identify appliances.  you can get 20th w/ just P/Q alone.
